This library was grabbed for the purpose of calculating eclipse timing.

Found this software @ https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39146-precision-sun-ephemeris

It looks like it's not totally accurate when compared to right ascension and declination obtained at https://theskylive.com....of by ~0.1 degree for solar ephemeris on 1/24/2017. But that shouldn't be a big deal when it comes to calculating eclipse times.
